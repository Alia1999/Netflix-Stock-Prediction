# Netflix-Stock-Prediction

This dataset was taken from Kaggle and I used a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model to predict the adj close values. However, to be noted here that the modeling does not forecast stock values, that will be done in a separate project, it only predicts the adj closing value based on other factors like opening value, high, low and volume for the day.
